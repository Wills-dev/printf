# 0x11. C - printf

## Description:
This printf project is a collaboration between Ejiogu Victor and Anyaegbu Kelechi who are Software Engineers studing at ALX school. This project involves a function named "_printf" which would imitate the actual "printf" command located in the stdio.h library.

## What you would learn from this project:
* How to use git in a team setting.
* Applying variadic functions to big projects.
* The complexities of printf.
* Managing a lot of files and finding a good workflow.


## All files were created and compiled on Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS using GCC 4.8.4 with the command gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra pedantic *.c

If the program runs successfully, the return value is the amount of chars printed.
